# Project Overview

## What This Project Does:
This project consists of two Python scripts (`decrytption.py` and `encryption.py`) and a `requirements.txt` file that specifies the required Python packages. Here's what each part of the project does:

### **Script 1: `encryption.py`** (QR Code Generation with Encryption)
- This script takes user input (string or JSON data) and encrypts it using AES encryption in CBC mode.
- It generates two QR codes:
  1. **Encrypted Data QR**: Contains the base64-encoded encrypted data.
  2. **Decryption Token QR**: Contains the base64-encoded decryption token (AES key + IV).
- These QR codes are saved locally as `encrypted_data_qr.png` and `decryption_token_qr.png`.

#### How to Use:
1. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python encrypt.py
   ```
2. Enter the data you want to encrypt when prompted.
3. The script will generate two QR code images in the local directory: `encrypted_data_qr.png` and `decryption_token_qr.png`.

### **Script 2: `decryption.py`** (QR Code Decryption)
- This script reads and decrypts the content from the QR codes generated by `n14$898en.py`.
- It looks for two QR code images in the local directory:
  1. **`encrypted_data_qr.png`**: Contains the encrypted data.
  2. **`decryption_token_qr.png`**: Contains the decryption token (AES key + IV).
- If the QR code images are found, the script will decrypt the data and display the original content.
- If the QR codes are not found, you can manually input the base64-encoded data.

#### How to Use:
1. Ensure the files `encrypted_data_qr.png` and `decryption_token_qr.png` are in the same directory as the script.
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python decryption.py
   ```
3. The script will read and decrypt the data from the QR codes, displaying the original content.

### **Requirements**:
You need to install the required dependencies to run these scripts. You can install them by running:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
